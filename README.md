# CS50-Final-porject-Powercube-Tool

The purpose of this Flask webapp is to offer a structure that allows the user to complete its PowerCube analysis directly into a form that contains all the element of the  framework, and to render a styled document of this analysis. 



## Motivation

This is the final project for the CS50 class.  I wanted this project to be meaningful as well as useful. So I decided to link two of my passions which are social and environmental justice with coding! In the past, I have use the power cube to analyse power dynamic created by partcipatory methods for a research project. As I was implementing this framework to my analysis, I created an excel spread sheet to save the different elements of my analysis on the same page, which would allow me to have a global vision of my work. I decided to creat this app in order to facilitate the process of analysing and having a styled result at the end.
